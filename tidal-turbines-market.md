<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tidal Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tidal turbines market is primarily categorized into two types: Horizontal Axis Turbines (HAT) and Vertical Axis Turbines (VAT). HATs function similarly to wind turbines, utilizing blades aligned horizontally to capture tidal currents efficiently. They are known for higher energy output and are suitable for deeper waters. In contrast, VATs feature blades oriented vertically, allowing them to capture flow from any direction, making them more versatile in shallow waters. Both types contribute to renewable energy generation from tidal forces.</p></p>
